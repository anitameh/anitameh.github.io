## **Hi, I'm Anita!** 

I work in tech and have lots of different interests. Right now, I'm a senior data scientist and early member of the new [AI Labs](https://www.ft.com/content/4f5720ce-1552-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44) at [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual). 

I am part of (what some call) the first class of data scientists. I graduated right when [Hal Varian was predicting statistics would be sexy](https://flowingdata.com/2009/02/25/googles-chief-economist-hal-varian-on-statistics-and-data/), and have "grown up" on the front-lines as my field  rapidly evolved. 

This means I work in the intersection of data, engineering, product and business. That includes wading through ambiguous problem spaces; having deep user-empathy and an eye for simplicity; and being able to combine components from totally different fields in order to invent new ideas. 

I find true joy in reading and [writing](https://anitamehrotra.me/). Lately, I've been fascinated about bridging the gap between business and data science. 

**PREVIOUSLY**

I'm a hybrid data scientist. A running theme through my career has been using or building environments for machine learning solutions to revolutionize previously untapped areas, especially focused on [societal problems](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-vhacks-first-ever-vatican-hackathon/). Bayesian methods and education have special spots in my heart. 

Previously, I was a data scientist at [BuzzFeed](https://ghc.anitab.org/community-blog-ghc/virality-at-buzzfeed-anita-mehrotra/) and Accenture's R&D [Tech Labs](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/about/accenture-labs-index), where I built machine learning tools and platforms, and did some data-driven journalism.

**OTHER THINGS**

I hold degrees in mathematics and economics from UC Berkeley (go Bears!) and computational science and business administration from Harvard. 

From 2014 to 2016, I was lucky enough to teach a bunch of awesome girls at the Institute for Collaborative Education through [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/).

Originally a California girl, I now [ride](https://www.soul-cycle.com/) and live in New York City. If you can't get a hold of me, I'm probably on the hunt for an espresso or some sunshine.
