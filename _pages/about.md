Anita is a data scientist at BlackRock's AI Labs. Anita previously worked at BuzzFeed and Accenture's R&D Lab, where she focused on machine learning and data-driven journalism.

Anita is most passionate about using computational science and artificial intelligence technologies to solve societal problems, and has a special spot in her heart for Bayesian methods and U.S. K-12 education. Anita's hybrid skillset and full-stack approach to data science have evolved in tandem with the field she loves, something she sometimes writes about.

Originally a California girl, Anita now lives in New York City. If you can't get a hold of her, she's probably tapping it back at SoulCycle or on the hunt for an espresso.
