## **Hi, I'm Anita!** 

I work in tech and have lots of different interests. Currently, I'm the product manager for the suite of Aladdin developer and data science tools at [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/aladdin/products/aladdin-studio). 

I am part of what some call the "first class of data scientists," and graduated from Cal (go bears!) right when [Hal Varian was predicting statistics would be sexy](https://flowingdata.com/2009/02/25/googles-chief-economist-hal-varian-on-statistics-and-data/). Since then, I've grown up on the front-lines as my field rapidly evolved. 

I've also failed a lot and learned a lot along the way. I get most jazzed when I am combining different components of totally different fields, in order to invent new ideas at the intersection of machine learning and product. That's manifested by leading my team through ambiguous problem spaces, and being a good listener and question-asker.

This site is also a place where I aggregate my [writing](https://anitamehrotra.me/), something I love doing and am investing more time towards. Lately, I've been fascinated by how we can better bridge the gap between data science and disruptive innovation. 

**PREVIOUSLY**

I've built tools or created environments for evolving previously untapped areas, with a focus on [societal problems](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-vhacks-first-ever-vatican-hackathon/). Bayesian methods and education have special spots in my heart. 

Before my current role, I was an early member and senior data scientist in BlackRock's new [AI Labs](https://www.ft.com/content/4f5720ce-1552-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44), at [BuzzFeed](https://ghc.anitab.org/community-blog-ghc/virality-at-buzzfeed-anita-mehrotra/), and in Accenture's R&D [Tech Labs](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/about/accenture-labs-index). I also went back to school a [couple](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/applied-computation/graduate-programs/masters-computational-science-and-engineering) [of times](https://www.hbs.edu/about/Pages/default.aspx). 

**OTHER THINGS**

A couple of years ago, I had a blast teaching a bunch of awesome girls at the Institute for Collaborative Education through [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/).

Originally a California girl, I now [ride](https://www.soul-cycle.com/) and live in New York City. If you can't get a hold of me, I'm probably reading or on the hunt for some sunshine.
